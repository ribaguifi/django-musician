```

```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

```
5. Start django devel server (check everything is ok)

## How to generate/update translations

1. Go to musician folder and run:
```bash
cd django-musician/musician
../manage.py makemessages
```

```bash
processing locale ca
processing locale es
```

2. Edit generated `.po` files and save it when you have finished.
```

musician/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/django.po  # spanish
```

3. To able to use a `.po` file in an application, it needs to be compiled to the binary `.mo` file format.
```bash
../manage.py compilemessages
```
